# What is an IDE

## Objectives

  1. understand why IDEs are powerful
  2. understand what IDEs are doing in the background

## Outline

  * Explain that Swift is a compiled language, all Swift code must be compiled to machine code
  * Projects are made up of many (sometimes thousands) of files
  * Bad old days, you used to have to remember a long compile (command, maybe show some?)
  * IDE or integrated development environments came around to solve that problem
  * The Integrated part, meant it also came with a bunch of debugging and documentation tools
  * XCode came around to be the IDE for iOS applications, also integrates in the interacting with phones stuff
  * XCode both builds (show them) and will run the code on a simulator (show them)
  * Xcode also integrates the testing frameworks. Hence the cmd-u the students will have already seen
